### Quick Start

#### Install
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd FrontEnd` in terminal to position yourself in the FrontEnd folder \
Step 3: Run `npm install`

This will install all the packages and their dependencies used by the app. You need to complete this before building, running or testing the app.

Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd FrontEnd` in terminal to position yourself in the FrontEnd folder \
Step 3: Run `npm run build` 

#### Run application
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd FrontEnd` in terminal to position yourself in the FrontEnd folder \
Step 3: Run `npm start` or `npm run start` 

A browser window should open automatically. If no browser window opens, open one manually and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

#### Run unit tests
Step 1: Open Terminal \
Step 2: Run `cd FrontEnd` in terminal to position yourself in the FrontEnd folder \

### 1. Stem Majors overwhelmed	
University students, particularly those in STEM majors, are feeling overwhelmed, with their schedules becoming more packed every day, leaving little room for relaxation or enjoyment. 
With Ever changing and evolving technology students in STEM need to spend extra time learning the new technologies for their majors. New technologies such as Improved or new programs like Constantly Learning new technologies takes extra time out of those students' days leaving little time for other activities. 
Students in STEM majors are more often than not required to complete large projects along with large exams. Having large outside projects eats into the time STEM majors have dedicated to rest of their life. Any other classwork/Homework, which there is a Good chance that they have another class which Also requires Larger projects as well. Any Work time from jobs, and as stated above, Time to learn the new Technologies in the field. So with all the above the time STEM students have their time cannibalized by school with little to no time for relaxation and enjoyment. A method to help combat this lack of time is time management.How can we help STEM majors manage their Time so that they get the breaks they need?

### 2	 Difficulties Reading Code
Many starting programmers have difficulties reading and understanding code. This causes problems with learning and could lead to other issues such as imposter syndrome.Often learning materials focus on higher level Ideas, that causes those missing the foundational ideas to have a disconnect in understanding. How can we simplify code to make it more readable and approachable for beginners?


## Meeting Times <br/>
Saturdays sprint and Async Scrum at 1:00 PM to 2ish <br/>
Thursday Sprint and end of Sprint Review at 6:00 PM to 7:00ish PM <br/>

## Communication policy <br/>
Official communication policy is: Discord will be the main form of communication. With @TeamB try to respond within 12 hours, if possible sooner. Try to only use @team if the entire team needs to see it. If you need to reach someone specifically, use @name, for example @Jakob Sholler try to respond to this within 12 hours as well if possible much sooner. And if there is something that desperately needs someone's attention you should direct message them. Try to save that as a last resort if possible.<br/> 

## Agenda <br/>
Thursdays are A weekly Sprint and End of Sprint meetings <br/>
Saturdays are The Other weekly sprint, and An Async scrum meeting after. <br/>
## Current Work
This is the current deliverable we are working on and the documents that are being turned in.

## Meeting Attendance Policy
Life happens, if there are factors that make you miss a meeting it is all good. There will be a note document in each meeting and will be in the shared goodle drive for out team. So you can view and see what we did during the meeting. If there are things such as assigning tasks during the meeting and you are out, then you will be stuck with whatever is left. 
## Deadline policy
Deadlines will be based on  the window of time for the assignment along with the number of tasks, Typically broken down into 3 periods, might be more if there is alot of work for a deliverable. The last day will always be cut off and used Exclusively for either touchups or finalizing quality checking. For example lets say there is 20 tasks total, and 7 days to do the assignment. it will be 6 days for the assignment, and 15 tasks. Breaking it into thirds  day 1-2 will be for the first set of tasks( for this case since there are 5 of us and we each have 3 tasks it will be 1 task for day 1-2 day 3-4 will be your second task and day 5-6 will be the third task. 
## Quality assurance policy
For quality assurance it will be pretty similar to the deadlines policy. For the quality insurance on the first batch of tasks they will be due by day 3-4 for batch 2 5-6 and for the final one is day 7.  This is set up so that in the case tasks are not completed untill the end of their deadline you can still give feedback. If you can, as soon as it is available complete the quality assurance on a task.
